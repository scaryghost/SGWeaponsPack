Usage:
The SGWeaponsPack mutator is designed to be used with Marco's Server Side 
Perks mutator.  You can download that mutator here:

To recieve perk bonuses with the custom weapons, add the following perks 
to the ServerPerks ini file.  The perks names are slightly altered from 
the base perks so you differentiate the two sets.

    Perks=SGWeaponsPack.BaseVetSupport
    Perks=SGWeaponsPack.BaseVetBerserker
    Perks=SGWeaponsPack.BaseVetCommando
    Perks=SGWeaponsPack.BaseVetFieldMedic
    Perks=SGWeaponsPack.BaseVetFirebug
    Perks=SGWeaponsPack.BaseVetSharpshooter
    Perks=SGWeaponsPack.BaseVetDemolitions

The mutator will automatically replace the stock weapons with the custom 
ones.  This includes the random drops and the trader list.  You DO NOT NEED 
to add the custom weapons to the trader list in the ServerPerks ini file.
